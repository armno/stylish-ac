WIP: Make ActiveCollab v.3 prettier.

### Notes

- _This project is opinionated and has no design directions._
- Base type is `Roboto` for sans-serif.
- I use monospaced (`Menlo`) fonts for some input elements. It is just my personal preference. (I know not everyone likes monospaced font).

### Tested environment

- AC version 3
- Google Chrome with [Stylish](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylish/fjnbnpbmkenffdnngjfgmeleoegfcffe) extension installed.
